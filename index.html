      <h2>Git</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Git</strong> is a distributed version control system used
        primarily for managing and tracking changes in source code during
        software development. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on a
        project simultaneously and keeps track of all changes made to the
        codebase over tiem.
      </p>
      <p>Here's a breakdown of how Git works and how to use it:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Repository:</strong> A Git repository is essentially a folder
          that contains all the files and folders for your project, along with
          the version history of those files.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Commits:</strong> A commit is a snapshot of the changes you've
          made to your files at a particular point in time. Each commit has a
          unique identifier and a commit message describing the changes made.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Branches:</strong> Branches in Git allow you to work od
          different features or fixes in isolation from each other. YOu can
          create a new branch from an existing one, make changes, and then merge
          those changes back into the main branch.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Merge:</strong> Merging is the process of combining the
          changes from one branch into another. This is typically done when
          you've finished working on a feature branch and want to incorporate
          thos changes into the main branch.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Pull request:</strong> In Git-based collaboration workflows
          like GitHub, a <strong>pull request</strong> is a way to propose
          changes to a repository. It allows other developers to review your
          code, provide feedback, and ultimately merge your changes into the
          main branch.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        To commit your changes to your GitHub repository from your local
        machine, you'll typically follow these steps using Git commands:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Add files to staging area:</strong> First, you need to add the
          files you want to commit to the staging area. You can do this using
          the <strong>git add</strong> command followed by the file names or a
          dot (.) to add all files in the current directory.

          <pre>
      <code>
        git add &lt;file1&gt; &lt;file2&gt; ...
          # or
          git add .
          
      </code>
    </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Commit changes:</strong> Once the files are staged, you can
          commit them to your local repository along with a commit message using
          the <strong>'git commit'</strong> command:
          <pre>
    <code>
      git commit -m 'Your commit message here'
    </code>
  </pre>
          Replace 'Your commit message here' with a brief, decsriptive message
          summarizing the changes you made in this commit.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Push changes to GitHub:</strong> Finally, you'll push your
          commited changes from your local repository to your GitHub repository
          using the <strong>'git push'</strong> command.
          <pre>
    <code>
      git push origin main
    </code>
  </pre>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        This sequence adds all changes in your current directory to the staging
        area, commits those changes with a commit message, and then pushes those
        changes to the <strong>'main'</strong> branch of your GitHub repository.
        Make sure to replace <strong>'main'</strong> with the actual branch name
        if you're working on a different branch.
