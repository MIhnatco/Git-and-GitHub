      <h2>Git</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Git</strong> is a distributed version control system used
        primarily for managing and tracking changes in source code during
        software development. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on a
        project simultaneously and keeps track of all changes made to the
        codebase over tiem.
      </p>
      <p>Here's a breakdown of how Git works and how to use it:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Repository:</strong> A Git repository is essentially a folder
          that contains all the files and folders for your project, along with
          the version history of those files.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Commits:</strong> A commit is a snapshot of the changes you've
          made to your files at a particular point in time. Each commit has a
          unique identifier and a commit message describing the changes made.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Branches:</strong> Branches in Git allow you to work od
          different features or fixes in isolation from each other. YOu can
          create a new branch from an existing one, make changes, and then merge
          those changes back into the main branch.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Merge:</strong> Merging is the process of combining the
          changes from one branch into another. This is typically done when
          you've finished working on a feature branch and want to incorporate
          thos changes into the main branch.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Pull request:</strong> In Git-based collaboration workflows
          like GitHub, a <strong>pull request</strong> is a way to propose
          changes to a repository. It allows other developers to review your
          code, provide feedback, and ultimately merge your changes into the
          main branch.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        To commit your changes to your GitHub repository from your local
        machine, you'll typically follow these steps using Git commands:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Add files to staging area:</strong> First, you need to add the
          files you want to commit to the staging area. You can do this using
          the <strong>git add</strong> command followed by the file names or a
          dot (.) to add all files in the current directory.

          <pre>
      <code>
        git add &lt;file1&gt; &lt;file2&gt; ...
          # or
          git add .
          
      </code>
    </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Commit changes:</strong> Once the files are staged, you can
          commit them to your local repository along with a commit message using
          the <strong>'git commit'</strong> command:
          <pre>
    <code>
      git commit -m 'Your commit message here'
    </code>
  </pre>
          Replace 'Your commit message here' with a brief, decsriptive message
          summarizing the changes you made in this commit.
        </li>

        <li>
          You can use the <strong>'git status'</strong> command to see the
          changes you've made to your files that are not yet staged for commit:
          <ol>
            <li>Open Command Prompt</li>
            <li>
              Navigate to the directory where your changed file is located using
              the 'cd' command
            </li>
            <li>
              Once you are in the directory, type the following command and
              press Enter
              <code>
                <pre>
        git status
      </pre
                >
              </code>
              This command will show you the status of your working directory
              and staging area. It will display which files have been modified,
              which files are staged for commit, and which files are untracked.
              <br />
              Additionally, <strong>'git status'</strong> will provide
              instructions on how to stage or discard changes based on its
              output. <br />
              By using <strong>'git status'</strong> , you can get a clear
              overview of the changes you've made and decide how to proceed with
              committing them to your repository.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Push changes to GitHub:</strong> Finally, you'll push your
          commited changes from your local repository to your GitHub repository
          using the <strong>'git push'</strong> command.
          <pre>
    <code>
      git push origin main
    </code>
  </pre>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        This sequence adds all changes in your current directory to the staging
        area, commits those changes with a commit message, and then pushes those
        changes to the <strong>'main'</strong> branch of your GitHub repository.
        Make sure to replace <strong>'main'</strong> with the actual branch name
        if you're working on a different branch.
      </p>

      <p>
        To update your GitHub repository with the changes you've made to your
        local files, you'll need to follow these steps:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Add files to the staging area:</strong> Use the
          <strong>'git add'</strong> command to add the changes you've made to
          your <strong>'index.html'</strong> file to the staging area. Navigate
          to the directory containing your file in Command Prompt and execute:
          <pre>
  <code>
    git add index.html
  </code>
</pre>
          This command stages the <strong>'index.html'</strong> file for commit.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Commit changes:</strong> Once the file is staged, you can
          commit the changes to your local repository with a commit message
          using the <strong>'git commit'</strong> command:
          <pre>
    <code>
      git commit -m 'Updated index.html with new HTML tags'
    </code>
  </pre>
          Replace 'Updated index. html wit new HTML tags' with a descriptive
          commit message summarizing the changes you've made.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Push changes to GitHub:</strong> Finally, you'll push the
          committed changes from your local repository to your GitHub repository
          using the <strong>'git push'</strong> command:
          <pre>
      <code>
        git push origin main
      </code>
    </pre>
          This command pushes the changes to the <strong>'main'</strong> branch
          of your GitHub repository. If you're working on a different branch,
          replace <strong>'main'</strong> with the name of your branch.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Now, your changes should be reflected in your GitHub repository. You can
        verify this by visitin your repository on the GitHub website and
        checking the contents of the <strong>index.html</strong> file.
